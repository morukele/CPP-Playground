# C++ Playground

A repository for learning and implementing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using C++.

## Overview

This project is a hands-on learning space where I practice implementing fundamental DSA concepts in C++. Each file contains implementations of key algorithms and data structures with detailed explanations of how they work.

## What's Inside

### Data Structures

- **Linked List** (`linked_list.cpp`) - A fundamental data structure with nodes and pointers
- **Hash Map** (`hash_map.cpp`) - Key-value pair storage and retrieval
- **Set** (`set.cpp`) - Collection of unique elements

### Algorithms

#### Searching & Sorting

- **Binary Search** (`binary_search.cpp`) - Efficiently find values in sorted arrays
- **Two Pointers** (`two_pointers.cpp`) - Solve problems using two pointer technique
- **Sliding Window** (`sliding_window.cpp`) - Optimize problems using a moving window

#### Graph Algorithms

- **BFS (Breadth First Search)** (`bfs.cpp`) - Explore graphs and trees level by level

#### Problem Solving

- **Two Sum** (`two_sum.cpp`) - Find two numbers that add up to a target
- **Prime Numbers** (`prime_numbers.cpp`) - Identify and work with prime numbers
- **Sub Array with Largest Sum** (`sub_array_with_largest_sum.cpp`) - Find the maximum sum subarray
- **Linked List to Array** (`linked_list_to_array.cpp`) - Convert linked lists to arrays
- **Function Declaration** (`function_decleration.cpp`) - Function declaration examples

### CPP Idioms
- **Pointer to Implementation** - an implementation of the pointer to implementation C++ idiom.

## Building the Project

This project uses CMake for building. To compile and run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Alternatively, if you have a build task configured, you can use:

```bash
cmake-build-debug/cpp_playground
```

## Getting Started

Each source file includes comments explaining the algorithms and data structures. To explore:

1. Start with simpler concepts like **Binary Search** and **Two Pointers**
2. Move to data structures like **Linked Lists**
3. Progress to more complex algorithms like **BFS**

## Requirements

- C++20 or later
- CMake 4.0+
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning tool to strengthen my understanding of:

- Core DSA concepts
- C++ syntax and best practices
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Data structure implementation

## Notes

All implementations are written for educational purposes to deepen understanding of how these algorithms and data structures work under the hood.
